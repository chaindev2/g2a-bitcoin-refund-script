# G2A Bitcoin Refund Script v4.0  
**Turning G2A into My Personal ATM for 6 Months Straight**

I’ve been outsmarting G2A for half a year, snagging free gift cards—Amazon, Google Play, you name it—and getting my Bitcoin refunded every damn time. This repo’s got the goods: a JavaScript hack that exploits G2A’s payment system. Pay with BTC, get your order, and watch the crypto bounce back like it’s nothing. I’ve cleared thousands flipping these cards on Paxful, and now I’m tossing it out here for free. G2A’s too slow to stop this—join the party.

## What You’re Getting  
- **Script**: `bitcoin-refund-script.js` - The magic juice. Injects via Tampermonkey.  
- **Guide**: `G2A-Refund-Guide-v4.0.pdf` - Every step, from setup to dodging bans.  
- **Proof**: check proof images

## How It Works  
1. Slap the script into Tampermonkey.  
2. Hit G2A, add 0.001 BTC+ worth of stuff to your cart (e.g., \$500 Amazon card).  
3. Pay with Bitcoin.  
4. Script glitches their system—order ships, BTC refunds in ~15 mins.  
5. Laugh, sell the card, repeat.  

Last week, I grabbed a \$500 Amazon card, paid 0.006 BTC, got it refunded in 12 minutes, and spent it on gear. Been doing this since October 2024—G2A’s funding my hustle, and I’m undefeated.

## Setup  
1. Install Tampermonkey: [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) | [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd).  
2. Open Tampermonkey, click “Create a new script,” paste `bitcoin-refund-script.js`.  
3. Save it. Hit G2A and follow the PDF.  
4. Use 0.001 BTC or more—lower amounts need support, and they’ll sniff you out.  

## Files

- `G2A-Refund-Guide-v4.0.pdf`: Full walkthrough—read it or fail.  

## Notes  
- Bitcoin only—other payments don’t glitch right.  
- VPN up if you’re paranoid; I use Nord.  
- Got banned? PDF’s got fixes—new IP, incognito, fresh email.  

## Flex Your Wins
